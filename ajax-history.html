    <h2>AJAX - History</h2>

    <p>
        Before AJAX, websites were typically built by linking multiple independent pages together in a predetermined sequence using links embedded within HTML. For users, navigating these traditional web applications meant moving from page to page, waiting each time for a new page to load. Each user action required a full page refresh, as HTTP requests were sent to the server to fetch a new page in response to every interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        This model, while functional, posed challenges for developing interactive applications such as Google Maps, real-time chat, and Gmail. The need for more dynamic solutions became evident. On February 18, 2005, Jesse James Garrett introduced AJAX in his article, “A New Approach to Web Application,” which brought asynchronous data exchange to web development. Then, on April 5, 2006, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first draft specifying the XMLHttpRequest object, marking a significant step in standardizing AJAX.
    </p>

    <p>
        Applications built with AJAX offer improved speed and responsiveness compared to traditional methods. AJAX enables partial page updates by exchanging only the necessary data with the server, rather than requiring a full page reload. This asynchronous data exchange between the browser and server allows web applications to continue running smoothly while waiting for server responses. At the heart of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, which makes these asynchronous requests possible.

    <h3>Core AJAX Technologies</h3>
    <p>
        AJAX utilizes a combination of technologies, each serving a distinct role in making asynchronous communication effective:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Manages client-side interactions and logic.</li>
        <li><strong>XMLHttpRequest (XHR):</strong> Provides asynchronous communication with the server.</li>
        <li><strong>XML/JSON:</strong> Formats for data exchange between server and client.</li>
        <li><strong>Document Object Model (DOM):</strong> Enables dynamic manipulation of web page content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The introduction of AJAX revolutionized web development, enabling developers to create rich, interactive web applications. In the next section, we’ll explore the differences between dynamic and static websites.
